# Python Game created with *OpenGL*
### The name has not been found yet ... If you have any ideas :-)

### What is it ?
It is a mix of *Civilisation* and *Age of Empire*.
It's a turn-based game similar to *Civilisation* with hexagonals tiles.

It takes place in a science-fiction world where you control a small planet and have to get ressources in order to evolve and conquer the whole universe.

Of course, you will have to build units and buildings, research new technologies and destroy your opponents to win the game.

### How to install it :
You have to install all the libraries below using the pip installer. Then you can use them directly or by creating a *virtual environement*.

Note : you might have to install PyOpenGL manually

### Libraries :
It coded in Python, it uses a bunch of libraries binded in Python :
- PyOpenGL (http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/)
- GLFW (https://github.com/glfw/glfw)
- Python Imaging Library (https://python-pillow.org/)

It also uses the *numpy* library as well as the *math*
